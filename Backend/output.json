        "main_text": "WASHINGTON: A person in the state of Missouri has become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu without a known exposure to infected animals, authorities said on Friday (Sep 6).\nThe adult patient, who has underlying conditions, was admitted to hospital on Aug 22, received antiviral medications against influenza, then recovered and was discharged, according to statements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.\nAs the patient's flu type appeared suspicious on an initial test, it was sent for additional testing in state and federal laboratories, which revealed it was H5, also known as avian flu or bird flu.\nThe CDC said it had not identified any transmission to the patient's close contacts or any other person.\nScientists have voiced concern about the growing number of mammals becoming infected by bird flu, even if cases in humans remain rare.\nThey fear a high rate of transmission could facilitate a mutation of the virus, which could enable it to be passed from one human to another.\nContacted by AFP, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday it was \"encouraging that the national disease surveillance system has identified this case, that the patient received antiviral treatment, and that no further cases have been detected among close contacts\".\n\"It is critical that investigations into the patient's exposure are continued, as indicated by national and state authorities, to inform further prevention and response activities,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention.\n\"WHO strongly supports US efforts for surveillance of zoonotic influenza across human, environmental and animal sectors,\" Van Kerkhove continued.\n\"It is important to understand the circulation of avian influenza in poultry, wild birds and other animals in the state,\" she said of Missouri.\n\"Stronger disease surveillance in animals is essential to protect animal and human health.\"\nNO ANIMAL CONTACT\nThe person who tested positive for bird flu was the 14th to do so in the US this year, and the first without known contact with animals.\nIndeed, \"no H5 infection in dairy cattle has been reported in Missouri\", said the Missouri health department, though \"some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds have been reported\".\nAll previous bird flu cases in the US have been among farmworkers, including the very first, in 2022.\nBird flu is most commonly found in wild birds and poultry, but has more recently been detected in mammals, with an outbreak in cattle seen across the country this year.\nIt can occasionally infect humans through close contact or contaminated environments.\nWhile the CDC continues to assess the risk to the public as low, \"circumstances may change quickly as more information is learned\", it said.\nIn the decades since H5 has been found in humans, there have been rare cases where an animal source cannot be identified.\nBut there has so far not been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which would significantly increase the threat level.",

        "main_text": "The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered its 12th month on Saturday (Sep 7) with little sign of respite for the Palestinian territory or hope for Israeli hostages still held captive.\nThe chances of a truce that would also free hostages held by Hamas in exchange for prisoners held by Israel appear slim, with both sides sticking doggedly to their positions.\nHamas, whose Oct 7, 2023, attack on Israel sparked the war, is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists that troops must remain on a key strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have all been mediating in an effort to bring about a ceasefire in the war that authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza say has killed at least 40,939 people.\nAccording to the United Nations human rights office, most of the dead are women and children.\nHamas's Oct 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.\nOf 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.\nScores were released during a one-week truce in November.\nIsrael's announcement last Sunday that the bodies of six hostages including a US-Israeli citizen had been recovered shortly after being killed sparked grief and anger in Israel.\nMarking the anniversary, UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X on Saturday: \"Eleven months. Enough. No one can take this any longer. Humanity must prevail. Ceasefire now.\"\nInternational pressure to end the war was further underlined by Friday's shooting dead in the West Bank of a Turkish-American activist demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the occupied territory.\nThe family of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi has demanded an independent investigation into her death, saying on Saturday her life \"was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military\".\nThe UN rights office said Israeli forces killed Eygi with a \"shot in the head\".\nAnkara said she was killed by \"Israeli occupation soldiers\", and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the Israeli action as \"barbaric\".\nWashington called her death \"tragic\", and has pressed its close ally Israel to investigate.\nWEST BANK RAID\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank - where about 490,000 people live - are illegal under international law.\nSince Hamas' Oct 7 attack, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 662 Palestinians in the West Bank which Israel occupied in 1967, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nAt least 23 Israelis, including members of the security forces, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period, Israeli officials say.\nEygi's death came on the day Israeli forces withdrew from a deadly 10-day raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, where AFP journalists reported residents returning home to widespread destruction.\nThe Jenin pull-out came with Israel at loggerheads with the United States over talks to forge a truce in the Gaza war.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that \"90 per cent is agreed\" and urged Israel and Hamas to finalise a deal.\nBut Netanyahu denied this, telling Fox News: \"It's not close.\"\nHamas is demanding Israel's complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, saying it agreed months ago to a proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden.\nAFP reporters said several air strikes and shelling rocked the territory overnight and early on Saturday.\nGaza's civil defence agency and the Palestinian Red Crescent said an Israeli air strike killed four people near the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.\nThe civil defence and a witness said an air strike that targeted a flat in Bureij camp killed another four.\nAnd in Jabalia, an Israeli air strike killed four more Palestinians, civil defence officials said.\nThey added that a woman and a child were also killed in an air strike north of Gaza City.\nMedics reported at least 33 Palestinians wounded in an air strike on a residential area in Beit Lahia and said they were being treated at the Al-Awda, Kamal Adwan and Indonesian hospitals.",

Pope had been under pressure after a run of low scores but silenced his critics with his seventh test century.\nOlly Stone was not out on 15 but ran out of partners after Josh Hull (2) and Shoaib Bashir (1) put up little resistance to a much improved Sri Lankan bowling lineup.",

And today was another night, massive drone attack,\" the Kyiv city administration said in a social media post on Saturday.\nDebris from one downed drone landed near the Ukrainian parliament in the centre of the city.\nIn the east of the country, three people were killed in Russian shelling on Kostyantynivka - in the Donetsk region where Russian troops are advancing - the local governor said.\nRussia's military said on Saturday it had seized the village of Kalynove, around 25km southeast of the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk, which Russia is seeking to capture.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia's \"primary objective\" in the conflict was to capture the entire Donbas region - which consists of Ukraine's Donetsk and Lugansk regions.\nMoscow claimed to have annexed them, along with the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in 2022, months after it launched its full-scale military offensive and despite not having full control over them.\nThe head of Ukraine's neighbouring Dnipropretovsk region said the number of wounded in a missile attack on the city of Pavlograd a day earlier had increased to 82, including seven children.\n\"Sixty people remain in hospital,\" Governor Sergiy Lysak said.\nOn the diplomatic front, Ukrainian President Volodymyr met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on the sidelines of an economic forum in the country on Saturday.\nMeloni reaffirmed her strong support for Kyiv.\nZelenskyy was using the brief trip to Europe, which also included meetings with Germany's Olaf Scholz and an address to the Ramstein defence summit, to press allies for more weapons supplies.",

        "main_text": "SINGAPORE: Win at all costs. That was Joseph Schooling's approach to chasing - and securing - a historic gold medal for Singapore in the 2016 Olympics, and the retired swimmer remains unapologetic about it.\n\u201cFor me, winning was the most important thing, not getting second, not getting third, and surely not just being there to participate,\u201d the 29-year-old told CNA.\n\u201cHaving this yardstick of winning medals - winning gold medals - was very important to my success, because that pushed me day in and day out, to be better than those around me.\u201d\nSuch a result-driven approach would appear to put Schooling at odds with some of his country's official messaging in the wake of the Paris Olympics in August.\nIn a key speech that same month, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong spoke about Singapore\u2019s performance at the recently concluded Games, and said that sports was \u201cnot just about medals\u201d but also \u201cgrit and determination\u201d, doing one\u2019s best and \u201cpushing the limits\u201d.\nHe also urged a deeper culture shift among athletes and the public when it comes to defining success in sport.\nA few days later, Minister for Community, Culture and Youth Edwin Tong also said that leaving aside medals, Singapore\u2019s athletes had come \"first\" for other sporting qualities such as determination and fortitude while competing, as well as pride in representing their nation.\nIn his speech, titled \u201ca new path to sporting success in Singapore\u201d, Mr Tong announced several moves to achieve this, including a new scholarship for student-athletes.\nOn the back of Singapore kitefoiler Maximilian Maeder clinching a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, the minister has also pledged more support to athletes in niche and uncommon sports.\nBut will this strategy - comprising both concrete measures and calls for a mindset change - necessarily translate to sporting success? And what would such \"success\" look like going forward, for a country that's tallied six medals in 76 years of competing on the biggest stage for sports?\nSPORTS AS CAREER\nSingapore's high-performing athletes have long had to deal with the perception that pursuing their sport seriously could set them back in their careers.\nThis has lingered throughout wushu exponent Kimberly Ong's time in the sport, especially when many of her national teammates were dropping out to focus on their studies.\n\u201cThere's definitely this societal stereotype that academics are more important than sports, and (that) there's a longer runway if you pursue your academics over sports,\u201d said the 21-year-old, who clinched a bronze medal at the 2023 Asian Games.\n\u201cI feel like a lot of our talent pool is being lost because of these kinds of considerations.\u201d\nThe pressures faced by parents can weigh just as heavily, even though the prime minister said in his speech that parents are now more convinced to support the dreams of high-performance athletes.\nOng\u2019s mother Pauline Sim recalled that when her daughter was transferred in 2018 from a mainstream secondary school to the Singapore Sports School, many friends approached the family to ask why they were \u201csacrificing her academics for the sake of her sports\u201d.\n\u201cWe were very shocked back then, as we had never intended for her to give up pursuing academic excellence \u2013 we just wanted her to enjoy better support in terms of her sports while continuing to study hard and achieve desirable grades,\u201d said the 51-year-old.\nThis appears to be what the government also hopes to achieve, by introducing a scholarship for undergraduate student-athletes.\nWhile Ong is already on a university scholarship, juniors such as her younger sister Kassandra might stand to benefit.\n\u201cWe've always had to go under external academic scholarships, like from the universities or other ministries,\u201d said Ong.\n\u201cSo I think (the new scholarship) would definitely ease (my junior\u2019s) concerns about the future, because in one way, it kind of reassures them that there's support in terms of the academic area.\u201d\nResponding to queries from CNA, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Community, Culture and Youth (MCCY) said that mindsets towards pursuing a sporting career are changing.\nFor instance, more talented young Singaporeans are taking sports more seriously and parents are also becoming more supportive of their children\u2019s sporting careers.\nThe spokesperson added that through the new schemes, the government wants to \u201cassure aspiring and current athletes that they can pursue sporting excellence without worrying too much about education and employability\u201d.\nThe initiatives \u201chelp athletes at various stages and across various facets of their lives \u2013 so that they can thrive in both their sporting and non-sporting endeavours\u201d, said the spokesperson.\nMay Schooling believes she \"would have a lot less white hairs\" if this level of support was available 15 years ago, when her son first burst onto the swimming scene.\n\u201cIt might have been easier for us as a family when the Schoolings decided to go on this path to the Olympics,\u201d said the 69-year-old, an accountant at a manufacturing machinery business.\nKey parts of Schooling's Olympic journey - such as financing his training in the United States - were \"all on\" his parents, said his mother.\nMeanwhile, the other announcement of top-ups to the Central Provident Fund savings plan - for those under the Sports Excellence Scholarship (SpexScholarship) programme - will contribute to longer-term financial stability for athletes, said members of the fraternity.\n\u201cWe are signalling to athletes and their families and support systems that sports does not have to be a losing proposition in monetary terms,\u201d said former national fencer and triathlete Nicholas Fang, now the managing director at a sports consultancy.\nHe added however that government efforts in this area might not suffice, and that there also has to be a more \u201crobust ecosystem of support from the private sector via sponsorships\u201d.\nFor former national diver and Olympian Jonathan Chan, this - and lucrative deals in particular - have been sorely lacking in Singapore.\n\u201cIf you really want to compare to other countries, the real difference is the amount of sponsorships they have,\u201d said the 27-year-old.\n\u201cIf you're a US athlete, you may have millions of people who know your name,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in Singapore, we only have a 6 million (population), and (not all) really care about sports \u2026 if people don\u2019t know you, brands won\u2019t sponsor you.\u201d\nNevertheless, some local firms have put their weight behind promising athletes.\nOne example is the 4.5-year, seven-figure partnership between DBS Bank and kitefoiler Maeder.\nMs Karen Ngui, head of DBS Group strategic marketing and communications and DBS Foundation, told CNA the deal was in part due to optimism that Singapore's sports scene will only grow stronger.\nShe also tipped her hat to other corporate sponsors and initiatives like the refreshed President\u2019s Challenge, and echoed the Prime Minister's call to not fixate on medals.\nDBS celebrates athletes \"not only for their achievements but also for their journeys and experiences gathered along the way\".\n\"Their attitude, spirit and commitment already make them winners, with or without a medal,\" she said.\nOPPORTUNITY IN NICHE SPORT\nAfter the Paris Olympics Mr Tong, the minister, said in an interview with CNA that Singapore will support promising athletes, even in new and less common sports.\nThis has already been in the works, with Maeder and his kitefoiling - which is new to the Olympic roster - receiving public and private sector support after being noticed by local authorities in 2021.\nIndoor skydiver Kyra Poh is another example. She has been included in the spexScholarship programme since 2022, despite her sport not featuring in any major Games - yet.\nDitto for wushu player Ong, who is a spexScholar despite her sport not being on the Olympic programme.\nPresident of the Singapore Ice Skating Association Alison Chan said it was critical to support and invest in not just top performers but as a whole, the sport, its required infrastructure and all its athletes at different levels.\nShe pointed to how the ice skating community here was dealt a blow when the country's only Olympic-sized rink was closed last year.\nHowever president of the Kitesurfing Association of Singapore Ong Rong Quan said it was understandable that resources are limited.\n\"You can't expect funding until you deliver something, so I think everything goes hand in hand,\" he said.\nHe added that most niche sports face the challenge in building a community from the ground up.\nEfforts are already underway to draw more attention and participation to niche and emerging sports.\nTake the inaugural Singapore Urban Sports and Fitness Festival launched by local governing body Sport Singapore (SportSG) last month.\nThe festival featured the likes of street dance, fitness racing such as Hyrox, parkour and bouldering, and drew over 70,000 participants across two weekends.\nMr Roy Teo, SportSG's chief of industry development and technology and innovation, told CNA the decision to hold this festival was due to sensing from the ground that interest in urban sports had grown over the past few years.\nThe intention is to encourage mass participation, but the festival also recognises international trends of niche sports becoming more established globally.\nIn the recent Olympic Games, \u201cnon-traditional\u201d sports such as skateboarding, sport climbing, surfing, breaking and kitefoiling were on the menu.\n\u201cThere are more and more (of these) going into major sports events, and I think that's a good thing,\" said Mr Teo. \"Who knows, we may have another champion from all these activities.\u201d\nExpanding support for athletes in niche and uncommon sports is a viable way forward for Singapore, and \"something to be excited about\", said Mr James Walton, sports business group leader at Deloitte Singapore & Asia Pacific.\n\u201cSince some niche sports are relatively new to the scene, the international playing field is more level compared to the more established sports,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThis in turn gives Singaporean athletes greater opportunity to shine on the world stage.\u201d\nSome might ask, however, if Singapore should instead focus on a few sports with the potential to consistently deliver medals.\nThat after all seems to be what other Asian sporting administrations as well as neighbouring countries are doing.\nHong Kong, for one, emerged as a fencing powerhouse at the Paris Olympics, topping the sport\u2019s medal table with two golds. It has been lauded for having a strong fencing culture dating back to the 1970s.\nAnd Malaysia has zeroed in on badminton while Thailand has enjoyed success in taekwondo and weightlifting.\nYet those in Singapore's sports fraternity who spoke with CNA disagreed with this pathway.\n\u201cWith a targeted approach there are fewer direct beneficiaries, whereas with an inclusive approach, more athletes will benefit,\" said former Olympic sailor Benedict Tan, now an adviser to the Singapore Sailing Federation.\n\u201cWe have to find the sweet spot, but I\u2019d rather \u2018cover my bases\u2019 and err on the side of inclusivity and diversity.\"\nPUBLIC PERCEPTION\nIf support from the public is crucial in achieving goals such as more sponsorships, as the diver Chan suggested, how then can the Singapore populace be encouraged to back athletes through thick and thin - and to perhaps define success differently?\nSportspeople are no strangers to criticism when the public perceives them as falling short of expectations.\nWhen Ong, the wushu exponent, attained a bronze at the Asian Games last year, an online comment told her not to be \u201ctoo happy\u201d with the medal.\nThen there's Schooling, who in the wake of his 2016 triumph shouldered intense scrutiny on everything from swim timings to weight and appearance.\nIt got to a stage where he was no longer obsessed and driven by Olympic gold, and was forced to change up what had worked so well for him for so long.\nDuring this period, Schooling found that a greater emphasis on process over outcome worked better for him. In this there are echoes of Mr Wong's point in his August speech, on how determination and doing one's best count just as much as medals.\n\"He's right, but we should see that as a baseline,\u201d said Schooling. \"We need to use this as a mantra and find a way to help athletes unlock their full potential.\u201d\nChan agreed that the two were not exclusive: Enjoying a sport and the journey can lead to results and that, as a whole, is success to him.\n\u201cWhen you look at Max (Maeder), when he\u2019s competing there is joy, and even in interviews you can feel he loves his sport,\" he said.\n\"Or like (Loh) Kean Yew, where you can see he has a real drive, and that is what drives other people, that inspires others to take up sports,\u201d he said.\nEchoing the prime minister\u2019s message, the MCCY spokesperson said that sporting success goes \u201cbeyond the medals we secure on international platforms\u201d.\nThe spokesperson said that sport plays multiple roles in Singapore society.\n\u201cSport is deeply rooted in the vibrancy of our community sports culture, nurturing unity, fostering resilience, and creating a platform for everyone to maximise their potential,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe seek to foster a broad-based sporting culture that allows all Singaporeans to experience sports and unite in their support of our athletes.\u201d\nThose in the sports fraternity said it was less a case of Mr Wong saying to give up on medal aspirations, and more of broadening the criteria for success.\nDr Tan, the ex-sailor, said that while medal tallies and ranking tables are \u201cestablished quantitative measures\u201d, there are other factors such as spectator numbers and sports participation rates.\nAnd Mr Fang from the sports consultancy described medals as part of the greater sum that is a country\u2019s national sports programme, which includes mass participation and industry development among others.\nStill, it would be a mistake to not focus on performance at all.\n\u201cDelivering results (at) competitions has the effect of uniting a nation,\" said the former head of Singapore's fencing and modern pentathlon associations.\n\"And inspiring one and all to dream big and commit to achieving our dreams.\"\n\"NATIONAL DNA\"\nTo Mr Fang, a milestone of sporting excellence for Singapore would be to do away with its famed Major Games Award Programme (MAP), which doles out the biggest cash rewards in the world for Olympic medals.\n\u201cIn time, if we succeed in elevating the role and significance of sports in our national DNA, while also enhancing the broader support that athletes can receive in pursuit of their sporting endeavours, the MAP might become unnecessary,\" he said.\n\"That might be a good thing for Singapore sports in general.\"\nTo get to this state is a complex task with no \u201cmanual\u201d to follow, said Mrs Schooling.\n\u201cThere is a clear strategy emerging (but) you can\u2019t just press \u201cplay\u201d and expect it to work.\n\u201cWhether there are still gaps, we will only know when we start the projects,\" she added.\n\"And the people in charge of the projects must be flexible, adaptable and (must) keep making improvements and not just stick to standard operating procedures.\u201d\nThe younger Schooling, somewhat wistfully, said: \"Many things are out of our control, but what we can control is the amount of support we can give our athletes, and how to raise not only certain sports, but collectively, our sporting level as a nation and to perform on a global scale.\"\nHe added that the most urgent areas in need of change were the \"public's perception of how powerful sports can be\" along with \"corporates\u2019 view of how valuable an athlete can be\u201d.\nAnd at the core of it is Singapore's lone Olympic champion hoping that his country can slowly awaken to the magic of sport.\n\u201cSports needs heroes. Sports needs a person or a team where the people can rally, unite around through good or bad,\" said Schooling.\n\"That's the real reason why people come to arenas to watch tournaments or competitions, because they're invested in their team\u2019s success.\n\u201cWe need to fabricate that kind of environment in Singapore, and it'll take time.\u201d",
